-Git
-version control system ,repo,staging area and commits,branches,issues and pull requets
-version control system 
-in an app we will update it and we will redeploy it 
-new updates =some bugs 
-we can revert back old update 
-to save the project in remote server 
-we can also track changes that are taken place before
-repo-project/folder
-github-remote repository  hosting service

= working directory- staging area- local repo-remote repo

-git init- intialize the project as git repository
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/seven/Desktop/git/.git/(.git file will be created)
-git status-to check status
-untracked files will be in working directory area
-we have to save it in remote repository 

-after saving it in local repo then only we can save to remote 
-we [push] command to save code from local to remote repo
-to save to local repo we use [commit ]command
-staging area useful single file saving situation to local repository
-working to staging area we will send single file -command we will use is git [add] file name
-git [commit] -m "we will pass some message for easy identification of the changes"
-github remote repo(origin)
-gitignore which files should be ignored
-to know remote folder to this folder we will use git [remote add origin] "https://github.com/yash/git-tuts.git"
-git[push]  -u origin main /master             
-git[branch] to which branch we are in (master)
-git [branch] -M main -it will change your branch from master to the main branch
//cls command is used to clear screen in command prompt


-Branches= 
-Main /master=code deploy /redeploy
-repo has diff branches
-10 people - 10 branches
-after their work completion they will do pull request
-10 diff copies - your wish branch name-push this codes to that branches
-pull request raise
-if team says ok for it merges it if not he will give some comments based on that you have to make changes to the code 
-if he says ok we can merge it to project
-git checkout (inorder to jump between the branches)
-to create new branch use -b like git [checkout -b] "copy1"
-inorder to make staging area file into the working directory area then we wil use git [restore --staged <file>...]" to unstage)
-
C:\Users\seven\Desktop\git>git push
fatal: The current branch copy1 has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin copy1

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

-usually the copy1 branch is the copy of the master branch
-we will be having compare and pull request=>merge pull request
-in github we have to perform the pull and merge operations
-a fork is a copy of a repository .forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project
-code >HTTPS> copy link
-to get project from the remote server github then create a local project 
-git clone urllink
-issues - we can raise also we can contribute with other issues
-git fetch- to bring changes 
-git pull - to make all changes to master branch whatever present in remote in our file

-git checkout dev2
