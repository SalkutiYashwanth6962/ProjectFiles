     //The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent
         The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display.

The following values are allowed:

dotted - Defines a dotted border
dashed - Defines a dashed border
solid - Defines a solid border
double - Defines a double border
groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
none - Defines no border
hidden - Defines a hidden border
The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).
The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:

border-width
border-style (required)
border-color with different positions we can make different styles

Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
you can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

margin:auto
The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element
box-sizing:border-box(it will not create extra space of width it will adjust within that  width only)
Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
-To keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding, you can use the box-sizing property. This causes the element to maintain its actual width; if you increase the padding, the available content space will decrease.
Box Model: content padding border margin

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The color property is used to set the color of the text.
The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

direction	Specifies the text direction/writing direction
text-align	Specifies the horizontal alignment of text
text-align-last	Specifies how to align the last line of a text
unicode-bidi	Used together with the direction property to set or return whether the text should be overridden to support multiple languages in the same document
vertical-align	Sets the vertical alignment of an element

text-decoration-line: overline line-through underline  overline + underline
text-decoration-color
text-decoration-style double dashed wavy dotted
text-decoration-thickness
text-decoration

text-transform:uppercase lowercase capitalize
text-color text-transform 

The CSS Text Spacing Properties
Property	Description
letter-spacing	Specifies the space between characters in a text
line-height	Specifies the line height
text-indent	Specifies the indentation of the first line in a text-block
white-space	Specifies how to handle white-space inside an element
word-spacing	Specifies the space between words in a text

The text-shadow property adds shadow to text.
In its simplest use, you only specify the horizontal shadow (2px) and the vertical shadow (2px):

font family
font style:normal,oblique and italic
1 em= 16px
Responsive Font Size
The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window
to use multiple Google fonts, just separate the font names with a pipe character (|), like this:

The font property is a shorthand property for:

font-style
font-variant
font-weight
font-size/line-height
font-family

font awesome icons

In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

The four links states are:

a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

  list-style-type: circle,square,upper-roman,lower-alpha,none

  table borders : border,width,
  border-collapse:collapse sets the border be collapsed into a single border 

  The text-align property sets the horizontal alignment (like left, right, or center) of the content in <th> or <td>.

By default, the content of <th> elements are center-aligned and the content of <td> elements are left-aligned.

To center-align the content of  <td> elements as well, use text-align: center
The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment (like top, bottom, or middle) of the content in <th> or <td>.

By default, the vertical alignment of the content in a table is middle (for both <th> and <td> elements).

    
th, td {
  padding: 15px;
}

== to display the horizontal scroll bar if the screen width is less 
// <div style="overflow -xl:auto"


Property	Description
border	Sets all the border properties in one declaration
border-collapse	Specifies whether or not table borders should be collapsed
border-spacing	Specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent cells
caption-side	Specifies the placement of a table caption
empty-cells	Specifies whether or not to display borders and background on empty cells in a table
table-layout	Sets the layout algorithm to be used for a table


The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.

This panel contains a <div> element, which is hidden by default (display: none;).

It is styled with CSS, and we use JavaScript to show it (change it to (display: block;).

visibility:hidden; also hides an element.

However, the element will still take up the same space as before

div.ex1 {
  width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

div.ex2 {//this one is better for readability without any  horizontal movement of the content
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky
Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.

The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
display :inline-block helps us to specify the height and width on an element
Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
-To center an image, set left and right margin to auto, and make it into a block element
-The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.
-The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower the value, the more transparent:

The CSS background-origin property specifies where the background image is positioned.

The property takes three different values:

border-box - the background image starts from the upper left corner of the border
padding-box - (default) the background image starts from the upper left corner of the padding edge
content-box - the background image starts from the upper left corner of the content



CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)
 background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);

 background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2);
 #grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo,violet);
}

background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
piecharts related things :#grad {
  background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
  border-radius: 50%;
}

Shadow related
text-shadow
box-shadow

text-shadow: 2px 2px blur red;(horizontal vertical blur color)
The CSS box-shadow property is used to apply one or more shadows to an element.

The CSS word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line. 

CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
skew()
matrix()

With the CSS transform property you can use the following 3D transformation methods:

rotateX()
rotateY()
rotateZ()
CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
transition
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
